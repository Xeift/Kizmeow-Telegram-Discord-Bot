<summary>Does this script only works on public channels?</summary>
Yes. This script does *not* works in group(private/public), channel(private). The purpose of this script is *forward message in a public Telegram channel which you don't own it to a Discord server which only requires manage webhook permission*. If you are the admin of both Telegram group and Discord channel, you can try [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/explore), it's much more easier to set up.
