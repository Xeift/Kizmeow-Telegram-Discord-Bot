A bot that forwards Telegram messages to Discord via webhook. Kizmeow does not require any Discord or Telegram permissions, nor does it require adding any bots to Telegram group, the only thing required is the Discord webhook url.

The bot is under development, it only forward text messages and images currently.

<summary>Does this script only works on public channels?</summary>
Yes. This script does *not* works in group(private/public), channel(private). The purpose of this script is *forward message in a public Telegram channel which you don't own it to a Discord server which only requires manage webhook permission*. If you are the admin of both Telegram group and Discord channel, you can try [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/explore), it's much more easier to set up.
